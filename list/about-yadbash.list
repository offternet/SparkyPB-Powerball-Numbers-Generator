                  YadBash Simple Code Crafting

     YadBash is the term we selected to represent the creation of our

     Simplified Yad & Bash Code Crafting that non-programmers can easily follow. 

     We can all build easy user interfaces that accomplish basic tasks 

     such as most common Terminal commands.  

     YadBash Simple Code Crafting uses Yad Graphical User Interface "yadgui" to

     build the graphic windows and so much more that YAD GUI offers.

     Background functionality such as file processing, number crunching,

     program launching and multimedia playing is accomplished using 

     non-complicated BASH "Bourne Again Shell" scripting. We use BASH

     as it is used on virtually all Distros of Linux and is indeed used
 
     on all GNU Linux systems.

     YadBash and all our Simplified programs that we create is supported by  

     supported by Robert Cooper of Kingman, Arizona, USA.
